# _Big Systems View_


In 2016, completed the open source book:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_**Big Systems View: Bigger outlook, bigger thinking, bigger frame, bigger promotion on the world**_

The book rejects the traditional publishing mode, and adopts the form of directly publishing the electronic version on the Internet and inviting everyone to co_compile it, setting a precedent for free and open source electronic books.

The book immediately caused a significant response in the relevant fields after its release.
Based on the version 1.0 of the original book, various materials (PPT courseware, videos, blogs, articles, etc.) with more complete ideas and richer contents have been formed through continuous iteration. All materials and the original book can be retrieved and downloaded on the Internet, or go to the official website of the [Big Systems View]: http://www.holomind.com.cn .
